All endings have been written
All tears have set sail
But suddenly forgot what it was like from the beginning
On that ancient summer day that never returns
No matter how I pursue it
Young you are just like a cloud passing by
And your smiling face is extremely shallow and pale
Gradually disappearing in the mist after sunset
So I opened the yellowed title page
Fate has bound it extremely clumsily
With tears in my eyes, I read and reread, but I have to admit it
Youth is a book that is too hasty
